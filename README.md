# PyLiPD: A Python Package to interact with Paleoclimate Data. 

[Paleoclimate records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoclimatology) are often generated by small teams of researchers, and typically require years of work to understand how climate phenomena are recorded and embedded in the natural archive they are studying. These records are fundamental to our understanding of past climate change; however, to understand large-scale patterns of how and why climate changes, researchers must study changes across large spatial regions. However, because of the nuance and individualized nature of these datasets, analyzing large collections of these data is a challenge. This recognition has launched many international synthesis efforts (through the creation of working groups aimed at answering a particular question in paleoclimatology) over the past decade, bringing diverse groups of experts and data together and integrating them into a [common framework to support future analysis](https://lipdverse.org/project/). These compilation efforts, and the unified syntheses they have generated, have served as the foundation of many of the major studies in large-scale paleoclimate over the past decade, including global mean temperature evolution.

These synthesis studies have also been the main thrust towards the development of software to analyze paleoclimate datasets and standards to describe them. PyLiPD allows interating with the Linked Paleo Data ([LiPD](https://lipd.net)) format, which underpins many of the compilation effort described previously .

## Versions

See our [releases page](https://github.com/LinkedEarth/pylipd/releases) for details on what's included in each version.
